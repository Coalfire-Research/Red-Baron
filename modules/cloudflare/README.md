# CloudFlare Modules

These modules were built to quickly create CloudFlare zones, filters, and worker scripts to serve as red team HTTP redirectors and payload delivery options.

See blog post on Medium for background and capability walkthrough. Readme in subdirectories detail each module syntax. Example TerraForm config file can be found in examples folder.

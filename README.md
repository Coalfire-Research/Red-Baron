Red Baron is a set of [modules](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html) and custom/third-party providers for [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) which tries to automate creating resilient, disposable, secure and agile infrastructure for Red Teams.

# Third-party Providers

This repository comes with a few pre-compiled [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) plugins (you can find them under the ```terraform.d``` directory), some of these have been modified to better suit the tool:

- Linode Provider: https://github.com/LinodeContent/terraform-provider-linode
- GoDaddy Provider: https://github.com/n3integration/terraform-godaddy

The initial inspiration for this came from [@_RastaMouse's](https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse) excellent *'Automated Red Team Infrastructure Deployment with Terraform'* blog posts series:
- [Part 1](https://rastamouse.me/2017/08/automated-red-team-infrastructure-deployment-with-terraform---part-1/)
- [Part 2](https://rastamouse.me/2017/09/automated-red-team-infrastructure-deployment-with-terraform---part-2/)

And [@bluscreenofjeff's](https://twitter.com/bluscreenofjeff) amazing [Red Team Infrastructure Wiki](https://github.com/bluscreenofjeff/Red-Team-Infrastructure-Wiki)

Both of these resources were referenced heavily while building this.

# Setup

**Red Baron only supports Terraform version 0.11.0 or newer and will only work on Linux x64 systems.** 

```
#~ git clone https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/Red-Baron && cd Red-Baron
#~ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="accesskey"
#~ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="secretkey"
#~ export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"
#~ export LINODE_API_KEY="apikey"
#~ export DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN="token"
#~ export GODADDY_API_KEY="gdkey"
#~ export GODADDY_API_SECRET="gdsecret"
#~ export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="azure_subscription_id"
#~ export ARM_CLIENT_ID="azure_app_id"
#~ export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="azure_app_password"
#~ export ARM_TENANT_ID="azure_tenant_id"

# For Google Cloud Compute see https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/index.html#configuration-reference 
# and set the appropriate environment variable for your use case

# copy an infrastructure configuration file from the examples folder to the root directory and modify it to your needs
#~ cp examples/complete_c2.tf .

#~ terraform init
#~ terraform plan
#~ terraform apply
```

# Tool & Module Documentation

For detailed documentation on the tool and each module please see Red Baron's [wiki](https://github.com/coalfire/pentest-red-baron/wiki).

Most of the documentation assumes you are familiar with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) itself, [Terraform's](https://www.terraform.io/) documentation can be found [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html).

# Known Bugs/Limitations

- SSH keys are deleted only when you explicitly run ```terraform destroy``` (https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/13549)

- Variables in provider fields are not supported which removes the ability to spin up AWS instances in different regions (https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/11578)

- A resources ```count``` parameter cannot be a dynamic value which means we must pass it as a module variable instead of inferring it from the length of the list we give it as a argument (https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/14677)

- ~LetsEncrypt cert creation using the TLS challenge currently doesn't work due to the third-party terraform ACME plugin implementation (https://github.com/paybyphone/terraform-provider-acme#using-http-and-tls-challenges). (I probably could get it to work with some extra tinkering)~

- The GoDaddy modules replace **all** of the DNS entries instead of adding the specified record to the existing zone file due to the implementation of the third-party provider (https://github.com/n3integration/terraform-godaddy). (Not ideal and definitely need to work on this, but it will due for now)
